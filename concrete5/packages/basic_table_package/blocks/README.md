## The blocks Folder
In this folder are all the blocks this package provides, in this case [basic\_table\_block\_packaged](basic_table_block_packaged/README.md).
Important is that the folder name is blocks, but for namespaces, it is called Block. In this case the namespace to this folder is:  
\Concrete\Package\BasicTablePackage\Block
